## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned the DRY principle and tried to follow the practice on my script.

- This is something I could not figure out. 
I made the tip choice radio buttons so that only one can be selected. I set its display to none so that the default look of radio buttons are hidden. By doing so, I could not use tab to select each radio button, and thus select it via keyboard. So this app can be used only with a pointer device. I am not sure if there is a getting around or using radio buttons is a wrong design choice.

- The form was responding to a RETURN key on input boxes. I had to disable the behavior and I did so through javascript. I saw an article on StackOverflow using the following.
``` 
<form ... onkeydown="return event.key != 'Enter';">
```
This is definitely shorter than my scripting but I did not put an explicit code in html. (I felt it did not look good.) Wonder if one is better than the other.
